# BuyNothing iOS App Development Todo

## Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Initialize Git Repository
- [x] Create Xcode project with SwiftUI
- [x] Configure bundle identifier and basic settings
- [x] Set up .gitignore and initial commit

## Phase 2: Core Architecture Setup ✅
- [x] Create organized folder structure (Models, Views, Services, Utilities)
- [x] Set up modular architecture for easy feature expansion
- [x] Create essential data models:
  - [x] `USBCable` model with port types, speeds, and metadata
  - [x] `Item` base model for future expansion
  - [x] `User` model for people-centric features

## Phase 3: USB Cable Proof of Concept (Parallel Development with Git Worktrees)

### Track 1: Test Infrastructure (worktree-test-infrastructure) ✅
- [x] Set up Swift Testing target in Xcode project
- [x] Create test image repository with sample USB cable photos
- [x] Establish testing patterns and utilities
- [x] Create mock protocols and base test classes

### Track 2: Image Analysis Service (feature/image-analysis-service) ✅
- [x] Define `ImageAnalysisProtocol` interface
- [x] Implement `MockImageAnalysisService` for testing
- [x] Create Core ML model integration placeholder
- [x] Build cable detection logic with confidence scoring
- [x] Write comprehensive Swift Testing test suite

### Track 3: Camera Service (worktree-camera-service)
- [ ] Define `CameraServiceProtocol` interface
- [ ] Implement AVFoundation camera integration
- [ ] Handle camera permissions and errors
- [ ] Create async/await capture pipeline
- [ ] Build comprehensive test suite with mocks

### Track 4: UI Components (worktree-ui-components)
- [ ] Create hero cable display components (`CableCardView`, `CableHeroView`)
- [ ] Implement borderless image cards with animations
- [ ] Build responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- [ ] Create SwiftUI preview testing

### Integration Phase
- [ ] Merge test infrastructure to main
- [ ] Integrate image analysis and camera services
- [ ] Integrate UI components with services
- [ ] End-to-end testing and polish

### Voice Integration (Future Phase)
- [ ] Add Speech framework for voice commands
- [ ] Implement LLM-powered voice processing (OpenAI API integration)
- [ ] Create voice-to-action mapping for cable selection
- [ ] Test speech recognition permissions and functionality

### Cable Management Features
- [ ] Cable logging and categorization system
- [ ] Intuitive selection interface
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities
- [ ] Cable type detection accuracy improvements

## Phase 4: Foundation for Future Features
### Networking Layer
- [ ] Prepare modular networking architecture
- [ ] API client structure for future backend integration
- [ ] Local data persistence with Core Data
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Testing & Polish
- [ ] Unit tests for core models and services
- [ ] SwiftUI preview implementations for all views
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Performance optimization and memory management

## Next Steps (Future Phases)
- [ ] Expand to other item types beyond USB cables
- [ ] Implement auto-generated collages feature
- [ ] Add social bartering system
- [ ] Develop people-centric connection features
- [ ] Build decentralized or volunteer-funded backend

## Current Focus
**Starting with USB Cable Detection Proof of Concept**
- Priority: Core ML camera recognition
- Goal: Detect USB-A, USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB automatically
- UI: Beautiful borderless hero images
- UX: Voice commands for hands-free interaction

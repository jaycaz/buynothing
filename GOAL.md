# BuyNothing iOS App Development Goal

You are an expert iOS developer and UX designer specializing in community-driven marketplace apps. Create a comprehensive Xcode iOS app development plan and initial implementation for "BuyNothing" - a beautiful, people-first sharing platform.

**Core Vision:**
Build the most beautiful and intuitive BuyNothing experience possible, emphasizing human connection over transactions.

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. **Visual-First Discovery:** Auto-generated collages of available items as the primary interface
2. **Effortless Item Addition:** Camera-based item recognition with one-tap confirmation (no manual entry)
3. **Social Bartering System:** Enable negotiations and exchanges before any transactions
4. **People-Centric Design:** Prioritize community connections and user relationships
5. **Zero-Cost Model:** Either volunteer-funded web services OR decentralized peer-to-peer data hosting via phones

**Proof of Concept - USB Cable Manager:**
Start with a focused prototype for logging and selecting USB cables with maximum intuitiveness:
- **Smart Detection:** Use camera ML to automatically identify cable types (USB-A, USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, etc.)
- **Hero Visual Design:** Display cables in stunning, borderless hero images
- **Voice Integration:** Implement LLM-powered voice commands for hands-free cable selection
- **Intuitive Categorization:** Organize by port types, speeds, and compatibility

**Development Philosophy:**
**Prototyping-First Process:** Embrace rapid iteration and experimentation. Build quick, testable prototypes to validate ideas before committing to full implementations. Prioritize learning and user feedback over perfect code in early stages.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Native iOS Swift/SwiftUI development
- Core ML for camera-based object recognition
- Speech framework for voice input
- Clean, modern UI following iOS design guidelines
- Modular architecture for easy feature expansion
- Rapid prototyping capabilities with SwiftUI Previews
- Flexible data models that can evolve with user testing

**Deliverables:**
1. Complete Xcode project structure
2. Camera recognition system for USB cables
3. Voice command processing with LLM integration
4. Beautiful, responsive UI components
5. Data models for items and user interactions
6. Basic networking layer (prepared for either centralized or P2P architecture)

Create production-ready code with detailed comments, proper error handling, and scalable architecture. Focus on the USB cable proof of concept while building foundations for the full BuyNothing vision.
